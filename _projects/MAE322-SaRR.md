For my MAE322 Mechanical Design course's final project, student-led teams were task to design and manufacture a Search and Rescue Robot, capable of navigating a designated obstacle course set out by the instructors. As the sole member of my team with previous programming and electrical knowledge, I led our team to be the first in course history to be able to complete the course fully autonomously. I chose to use low-level sensors and designed the code on the Teensy microcontroller to use only minimal control-theory concepts to make the project replicable within the scope of the project for future students to learn from without requiring extended knowledge.

Here is a photo of our Robot (Wall-E)!
