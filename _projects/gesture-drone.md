*Add Gesture Drone info here.

Hello! This is my project page for the Gesture Drone - a modular autonomous computer-vision based quadcopter platform, developed by the Drone Team as part of Princeton University's Robotics Club. Computer-vision based gesture control was used as a benchmark goal to test the versatility of the platform, specifically within the realm of adapting close quarters human-robot interactions.
